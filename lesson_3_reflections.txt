When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote repo when I was working on multiple computers or with other people to be able to keep the code up to date and always have the latest version.
This would help me save time instead of keeping the code on a flash drive or something that I could potentially lose or misplace and then not have any of the code that I wrote.
